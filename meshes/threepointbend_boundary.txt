# Surface-ID, type, dof/vector, and value(s).
# Dirichlet boundaries:
# For "velocity", the fourth number is in mm/s (or the unit of the rate of the field variable)
# For "dirichlet", the fourth number is in mm (or the unit of the field variable)
# For "sinedirichlet"/"triangulardirichlet", the fourth part is frequency(Hz), mean(mm), and amplitude(mm), for example "20 1 2"
# Neumann boundaries:
# For Neumann boundaries, the third part is a series of floats denoting the vector of the neumann boundary (set 0 if is a scalar field).
# For "neumann", the third part is in MPa (or the unit of gradient)
# For "neumannrate", the third part is in MPa/s (or the unit of the rate of gradient)
# For "sineneumann"/"triangularneumann", the third part is dimensionless. And add a fourth part being frequency(Hz), mean(MPa), and amplitude(MPa), for example "20 1 2"
